                                    we have to face. What&#39;s most important is that you&#39;re using the app responsibly and safely. Slack&#39;s

                                    When using Slack there isn’t many challenges that have been documented or that we can find there really
                                    is only a few:
                                    It can become quite messy and discatered and you can start to lose track of things as multiple
                                    different conversations .
                                    The layout of the channel conversations can cause difficulty as one conversation after another it
                                    can be hard sustaining a full conversation.</p>

                                    <h3>Advice On Safety Precautions</h3>
                                    <p class="para2">
                                    With using any app you have to be careful on what you should share.
                                    Advice that I would give is to not share too much information, Slack can be used as an app for
                                    business and revealing too much about yourself or your life can seem somewhat unprofessional.
                                    In ties with the point above, be careful on how you text or say as everyone can view this
                                    information.</p>

                                </div>
            
                                <div class="sl1 cau">
                                    <h3>Age Limits</h3>
                                    <p class="para2">
                                    To use the app Slack you must be older than 16 years old.
                                    How it can be misused:
                                    Slack provides a service for all users called ‘Channels’, channels allows you to communicate to a person or
                                    a group through a hashtag set up by an admin when you join the hashtag you&#39;re a part of the group
                                    channel. E.G. #businessclub
                                    In regards to these ‘channels’ they can sometimes become more of a immature group chat than a
                                    professional outlet where groups of people can share their files, emails or notes.</p>

                                        <h3>Trolling/bullying</h3>

                                        <p class="para2">
                                        Linking in with the use of ‘channels’ bullying can happen as when joining groups with people who have the
                                        same interests but different outlooks can cause conflicts. There is not a lot of bullying documented on the
                                        app which is a positive.
                                        As slack was created for people to work together to communicate it unfortunately does not allow you to
                                        block, mute or report people. This reason being the app wants you to work together to solve the issue as if
                                        you were on a team.</p>

                                        Tips that can help when dealing with privacy from this app:
                                        When ever using any social media app never share any personal details like passwords, financial
                                        information.
                                         When ever using the app to communicate, remember that people can see directly who is talking so
                                        don’t say something you will later regret.</p>
